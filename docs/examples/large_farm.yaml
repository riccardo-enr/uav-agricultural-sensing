# Large Commercial Farm Configuration

Configuration optimized for large-scale commercial agricultural operations (200+ acres).

```yaml
/**:
  ros__parameters:
    # Large commercial farm boundaries (500m x 800m = ~250 acres)
    x_min: 0.0
    x_max: 500.0
    y_min: 0.0
    y_max: 800.0
    z_min: 20.0   # Higher altitude for efficiency
    z_max: 40.0   # Maximum safe operating altitude
    
    # Aggressive exploration for rapid coverage
    alpha: 2.0
    visit_threshold: 8.0    # Larger threshold for faster waypoint completion
    velocity: 15.0          # High speed for time efficiency
    
    # Timing optimized for area coverage
    waypoint_generation_rate: 1.5    # Faster waypoint generation
    trajectory_publish_rate: 20.0    # Higher rate for smooth flight
    
    # Enable automatic path generation
    enable_path_generation: true

# Expected flight characteristics:
# - Total flight time: Multiple batteries required
# - Coverage pattern: Long-range flights with efficient coverage
# - Image overlap: Moderate (sufficient for analysis)
# - Battery usage: High efficiency required
```

## Use Case

This configuration is ideal for:

- **Commercial farms**: 200+ acre operations
- **Commodity crops**: Corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton
- **Large-scale monitoring**: Crop health, yield estimation
- **Insurance assessments**: Damage evaluation
- **Supply chain**: Pre-harvest planning

## Expected Performance

- **Coverage area**: ~250 acres (100+ hectares)
- **Flight time**: 60+ minutes (multiple batteries)
- **Image resolution**: Moderate detail (20-40m altitude)
- **Pattern type**: Aggressive exploration, long-range flights
- **Waypoint density**: ~1 waypoint per 2500mÂ²

## Hardware Requirements

- **UAV platform**: Large fixed-wing or heavy-lift multirotor
- **Battery**: Multiple 20000mAh+ batteries or fuel system
- **Camera**: Survey-grade with wide field of view
- **GPS accuracy**: Differential GPS sufficient
- **Communication**: Long-range telemetry required

## Flight Planning Considerations

```bash
# Multiple flight segments (adjust boundaries for each segment)
# Segment 1: Western section
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator x_min 0.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator x_max 250.0

# Segment 2: Eastern section  
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator x_min 250.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator x_max 500.0

# Weather adaptation (reduce altitude in wind)
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator z_max 25.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator velocity 10.0

# Seasonal adjustment (lower altitude for detail during critical periods)
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator z_min 15.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator alpha 1.6
```

## Integration with Farm Management

This configuration can be integrated with:

- **Precision agriculture software**: Variable rate application
- **Crop insurance platforms**: Automated damage assessment
- **Supply chain systems**: Yield forecasting
- **Weather monitoring**: Flight timing optimization
