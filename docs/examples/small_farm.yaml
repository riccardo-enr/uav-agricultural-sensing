# Small Farm Monitoring Configuration

Configuration optimized for small-scale agricultural operations (10-50 acres).

```yaml
/**:
  ros__parameters:
    # Small farm boundaries (50m x 75m = ~9 acres)
    x_min: 0.0
    x_max: 50.0
    y_min: 0.0
    y_max: 75.0
    z_min: 8.0    # Low altitude for detailed imaging
    z_max: 15.0   # Sufficient height for safety
    
    # Conservative exploration for thorough coverage
    alpha: 1.3
    visit_threshold: 3.0   # GPS accuracy consideration
    velocity: 6.0          # Moderate speed for image quality
    
    # Timing optimized for detailed coverage
    waypoint_generation_rate: 0.8   # Allow time for data collection
    trajectory_publish_rate: 10.0   # Standard PX4 rate
    
    # Enable automatic path generation
    enable_path_generation: true

# Expected flight characteristics:
# - Total flight time: ~15-20 minutes
# - Coverage pattern: Systematic with local clustering
# - Image overlap: High (suitable for photogrammetry)
# - Battery usage: Conservative
```

## Use Case

This configuration is ideal for:

- **Family farms**: 10-50 acre properties
- **Organic farming**: Detailed crop health monitoring
- **Research plots**: University agricultural research
- **High-value crops**: Vegetables, berries, specialty crops
- **Precision agriculture**: Variable rate application mapping

## Expected Performance

- **Coverage area**: ~9 acres (3.6 hectares)
- **Flight time**: 15-20 minutes typical
- **Image resolution**: High detail (8-15m altitude)
- **Pattern type**: Conservative exploration with good coverage
- **Waypoint density**: ~1 waypoint per 100mÂ²

## Hardware Requirements

- **UAV platform**: Small to medium quadcopter
- **Battery**: 5000mAh+ for full coverage
- **Camera**: 12MP+ for 2cm/pixel resolution
- **GPS accuracy**: RTK recommended for precision

## Customization Options

```bash
# Smaller field (adjust boundaries)
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator x_max 30.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator y_max 40.0

# Higher precision (lower altitude)
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator z_min 5.0
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator z_max 10.0

# Faster coverage (increase alpha and speed)
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator alpha 1.6
ros2 param set /bioinspired_path_generator velocity 8.0
```
